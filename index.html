						</h3>
						<p class="main">Bizz is e-commerce app which is built with flutter and dart. This is an
							app
							where users can quickly buy clothes that they
							like in seconds. Users can also start their own shop and sell their clothes buy
							becoming
							a seller member. The users will be able to shop freely and easily with the app's
							minimalistic design and color.<br><br>

							This project is still in progress, at the present i just have finished the UI part.
							I am
							currently learning mongoDB and how it can be connected to flutter applications. With
							this, i would be able to improve my development skills. I am also planning to use
							stripe
							as the payment gateaway in the future.

					<h2 id='header-white'>#Social Media: Tinkler<br />
					</h2>
					<p class="main">Tinkler is social media app which is also built with flutter with light and
						dark
						mode. With this app, users can express themselves and update their followers about their
						day
						in different ways. Users can search and follow each other while also chat their friends,
						post, like, comment and customize their profile. Users can use their facebook to login
						or
						create an account.<br><br>

						I'm extremely pleased with how the project came out and it also really opened my eyes
						how
						much effort developers give to build these kinds of app. Building it is not easy as it
						seems
						and at the same, i
						really enjoyed it because i am learning. I used a new architecture for the app
						which is very similar to MVVM called Stacked Architecture and with it my development
						process
						become much better and i was able to seperate concerns much better.

					<h2>#Time Tracker: Time-Box<br />
					</h2>
					<p class="main">Timebox is a flutter job/time tracker app which is also available for both
						ios
						and android devices. I built this so that i would be able to practice different kinds of
						login, especially facebook and gmail which are both used largely by many people. With
						this
						app you can put your job, its tasks and their subtasks and check all of the them in
						entries
						page which includes the summary of them and calculates the total of earned money based
						on
						time and rate.<br><br>

						I'm very happy while building it, i used blocs with react to combine two streams of data
						and
						also conducted unit and widget tests and used mockito for easier testing. For login and
						storing the data, i used firebase for it. It is built in vscode and is written entirely
						with
						dart and flutter.

					<h2>#Utility: Covid-PH<br />
					</h2>
					<p class="main">A mobile application where users can check the latest statistics of cases
						using
						a covid API based on the data of
						DOH PH. An important feature of this app is that users can search hospitals and
						check their current facilities if they have vacancies or not for both covid and
						non-covid
						patients.<br><br>

						This app was a collaboration between me and my batchmate @DoggoDev which is also the one
						who
						made the api. While doing this application, i learned a lot of things that companies do.
						I
						would say that our collaboration is great because we always talk what to do in slack. We
						also used github for uploading changes and github actions for continuous integration.
						While
						making this app, we keep the SOLID principles in mind, and we strictly followed it. We
						also
						made it maintainable by using architecture and adding mock tests. I am mainly
						responsible in
						backend, and he is mainly responsible in frontend.
